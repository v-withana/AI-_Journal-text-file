Week 04


This week, I attempted to use AI for learning a particularly challenging topic in Python, specifically classes and objects. Essentially, I wanted to learn about the fundamentals of classes and objects. For that, I asked ChatGPT to explain classes and objects to me in a way suitable for kindergartners. It provided a good example by mentioning toy cars, such as identifying classes and objects. However, it did not provide me with any information about the topics I learned in class. For example, the professor explained the raise and return. I was more focused on the basic understanding.ChatGPT provided a good example based on Harry Potter characters because it had saved the memory, as I had expressed an interest in Harry Potter characters. It explained that all wizards are class-like in terms of their abilities and how they are sorted into the houses. This also explained to me the importance of using the self. I also tested my code, which included classes and objects, with ChatGPT. I think ChatGPT has missed some important points in the classes and objects, but it gave me a basic idea to clarify my confusion so far. I also tested my knowledge with the quizzes generated by ChatGPT.
