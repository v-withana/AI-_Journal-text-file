Week 08

This week I use Ai to understand a weekly topic of inheritance. 
For this I used both Claude Ai and the Gemini Ai.
I did this to understand which one gave me necessary information to understand the topic. 
First I asked both Ai to explain about the inheritance.
To my surprise, Gemini Ai gave me exactly what I expected for the class.
However, Calude Ai made a bit of hesitation by asking in which context, whether it’s OOP, normal life inheritance should it  be explained to me. 
I used Gemini Ai because since the first chat it gave me enough resources for understanding the topic.
However, the use of Gemini Ai word usage and the long description kind of made it hard for me to understand the topic. 
As a result, I have to ask the question again and again and use different kinds of examples for understanding.
