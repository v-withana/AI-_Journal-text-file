Week 09
This week I used Ai for the debug a code in Week 9 exercise. This week I wanted  to something interesting with debug with Ai. 
First I wrote the code by my self, then I paste on Gemini Ai, and ask Gemini Ai ans asked about "Why I didn't get the expected
results?" I asked like this becuase I didn't want direcly ask to debug this like I used to. I wanted to see how AI will
response to the same problem with different way of asking. Gemini, first generated a solid guide on why it didn't work.
Then debug it and show how this could improve without beign incorrect. I understood that just telling debug this to Ai is just we 
get the alomost good output. However, asking what's wrong can get an idea first adn then apply it to correct the code.
