Week 2
This week, I used AI to clarify some topics in Python. They are boolean and have no branching. For both tasks, I used ChatGPT. Because I had some confusion about Boolean, I asked ChatGPT to explain it to me like a beginner. It simplifies the content to understand Boolean very easily. Even though I didn't ask ChatGPT to explain no branching in Python for a beginner, it gave me a response for a beginner. From this conversation, I learned that the way we ask the question to ChatGPT, like the tone, is the way it generates the answer.
